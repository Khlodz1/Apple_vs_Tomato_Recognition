# Apple_vs_Tomato_Recognition
The main idea of this project is that it can recognize three fruits which are apple, tomato and banana. The model of this project can be saved after training and continue training anytime again. However, the original idea of this project was to recognize apple and tomato, but we decide to add banana to them since we thought tomato and apple are really similar to each other. Also, we want to see how it will recognize another fruit like banana which has different shape and color. Nevertheless, we are totally happy with the results of this project since it achieved around 95% accuracy.
